    | wordpressPassword | `T0p$3cr3t`
    | wordpressEmail | your Columbus State student email address |
    | wordpressFirstName | Your first name (i.e. `Jeff`) |
    | wordpressLastName | Your last name (i.e. `Anderson`) |
    | wordpressBlogName | Give it a name unique to your (i.e. `Jeff's Blog`) or something more fun and creative |
    | service.type | NodePort |
